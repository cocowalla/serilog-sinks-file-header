# Serilog.Sinks.File.Header Samples
There are 2 sample projects:
- Serilog.Sinks.File.Header.Sample: demonstrates writing tab-delimited logs with a header row, configured programmatically
- Serilog.Sinks.File.Header.ConfigSample: demonstrates writing CSV-formatted logs with a header row, configured from appsettings.json

In both projects, logs are written to files in `.\Logs`.
